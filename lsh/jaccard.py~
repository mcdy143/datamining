# Steps:
# 1. Read data and store in memory as a set of words for each document.
#    Don't read all. Just n (which you should accept from command line).
#    Maybe some error checking on n.
# 2. then get jaccard similarity between two particular documents
#    identified by their document id.
# 3. Write code to produce signature matrix with a specified number of rows.
#    Store in 2-D. num rows -> no. of hash functions.
#    num columns -> no. of documents
#    Remember to seed.
