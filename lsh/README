Daniel Alabi and Cody Wang

Files included:
summary.pdf: our lab report (graphs included).
jaccard.py: includes the code for both parts of the assignment except for
            creating plots.
plots.zip: includes all the plots that are in the lab report.
jaccardplots.py: code for plotting the graphs. Must be in the same folder
                with jaccard.py because it imports the functions from there.
