1. How many records are there?
   199523

2. How many attributes are there?
   40

3. How many attributes are continuous?
   7; continuous columns -> [0, 5, 16, 17, 18, 29, 38]
   How many attributes are nominal?
   33;

4. For the continuous features, what are the average, median, maximum,
and minimum values? What are the first and third quartiles (also known
as the 25th and 75th percentiles)?
   See output from program

5. For the nominal features, what are the distinct values, and how
many times do they appear?
     see output from program

6. For the numeric features, use R to make 2-dimensional scatter plots
of two features at a time (some sample code is at the end of this assignment).


Relationship in data:
From the scatterplot of age against weeks worked in year, we can
notice that there are people of ages between 18 and 80 that work
between 0 and 50 hours. That is, even the old (80 years) still have to
work.
